This plugin for Wireshark is a dissector that decodes the NSDP protocol used by
Netgear for switch configuration.

To use it, get a working Wireshark development environment, then put the NSDP source
in the `plugins` directory (should be `<wiresharkRoot>/plugins/nsdp`).
Then create `Custom.m4`, `Custom.make` and `Custom.nmake` in the plugins directory
accordingly to Wireshark's documentation (see *.example files).
Finally run `make` in Wireshard's root directory, it should generate the lib in
`<wiresharkRoot>/plugins/nsdp/.libs/nsdp.so`
